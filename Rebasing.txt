Rebasing

"It can mess things up" "It's not for beginners" "avoid at all costs" --- classic feelings towards rebasing. 
HOWEVER It's actually very useful, as long as you know when NOT to use it. 
Can be a very devisive command in the community. 

There are two main ways to use the git rebase command:
- as an alternative to merging
- as a cleanup tool

Say you have two people working on a repo. 
Person one creates a feature branch and is plodding along. 
Meanwhile person two works directly on main. 
The following day, person one sees the main branch is 3 commits ahead of their feature branch. 
In order to get this work, they would classically merge the main branch to feature creating merge commits. 
This might happen many many times over the course of the feature branches life generating "needless" merge commits. 

This all works, but can lead to a cluttered commit history. 
We can instead rebase the feature branch onto the master branch. 
This moves the entire feature branch so that it BEGINS at the tip of the master branch.
All of the work is still there, but we have re-written history.

So picking back up on the example, we've been merging in work from master onto our feature branch
By rebasing, we recreate all the commits of feature but moved to the tip of the master branch (still on the feature branch)
Essentially the most recent work on main is smooshed to the starting point of the commit chain on feature. 
Both branches still exist, the feature branch will just be ahead of the master branch at this point

So making sure you're on the feature branch (git switch feature):

git rebase master                       (rewrites the branch you are on so that the commits of master occur at the start of the commit chain for this branch)

This will cleanup the commit history significantly (no more merge commits)

So the previous example was a case of merging followed by a rebase, however rebasing can be used instead of merging completely.
Rebasing always moves us to the tip of changes we pull over. 



*** IMPORTANT: WHEN NOT TO REBASE ***

Why rebase? We get a much cleaner project history with no unecessary merge commits thus creating a linear project history. 

WARNING: Never rebase commits that have been shared with others. 
If you have already pushed commits up to Github, DO NOT rebase them unless you are positive no one on the team is using those commits.

SERIOUSLY: You do not want to rewrite any git history that other people already have. 
it's a pain to reconcile the alternate histories. 

You only rebase things on your machine that other people don't, so feature branches that you are working on etc. 
YOU NEVER WANT TO REBASE THE MASTER/MAIN BRANCH. EVER. EVEN IF THERE'S A FIRE.

*** IMPORTANT: READ THAT AGAIN. I MEAN IT. ***



Rebasing and conflicts

When conflicts occure while rebasing it will create a partial rebase up to the point of the conflict i.e. some commits will get re-written but the process isn't finished.
At this point you have 2 options:

1) run "git rebase --abort" to go back to before you tried to rebase
2) resolve the conflict in the same way we do when merging, 
   then mark them as resolved by adding the conflicting file (git add <conflicting-file>), DON'T COMMIT,
   then run "git rebase --continue"

*Personally, I would prefer to merge for the majority, resolving conflicts as needed, then end on a rebase to tidy up.*



Interactive Rebase: Cleaning Up History

Sometimes we want to rewrite, delete, rename or even reorder commits (before sharing them). 
We can do this using git rebase

git rebase -i HEAD~4         (Running git rebase with the -i option will enter the interactive mode, which allows us to edit commits, add files, drop commits etc. 
                              Note that we need to specify how far back we want to rewrite commits and that we are not rebasing onto another branch. Instead we are
                              rebasing a series of commits onto the HEAD the are currently based on)

Example:

You have a repo on Github containing some awful commit messages, wrong tense, maybe commits you made in error. 
You clone down locally. 
Check the git log. 
Make a feature branch. 
run git rebase -i HEAD~However-many-commits-back
It will open our text editor showing the commits you chose to edit with the following commands on the left
    -pick (use the commit as is)
    -reword (use the commit, but edit the commit message)
    -edit (use commit but sto for amending)
    -fixup (use commit contents but meld it into the previous commit and discard the commit message)
    -drop (remove commit, contents included)
    - (There are more but those are the most common)
Choose the relevant command, save and close the text editor
A new text editor window will open if you selected an option requiring it, again make changes, save, close
Rebase will finish with changes in place.
