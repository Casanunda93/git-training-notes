Only the owner can toggle the visibillity in the DANGER ZONE. 

Adding Collaborators

Only owner can remove collaborators. 
Collaborators are able to clone and push changes, but is still unable to view settings. 



READMEs
When you initialise a a repo on Github you have the option to create a readme.
A README file is used to communicate important information about a repo including:
-What the project does
-How to run the project
-Why it's noteworthy
-Who maintains the project

If you put a README in the root of your project, Github will recognize it and automatically display it on the repo's home page. 
READMEs are Markdown files, ending with the .md extension. Markdown is a convenient syntax to generate formatted text. 
GitHub is able to render Markdown files as HTML based on the simple syntax. 
For more information on how to use Markdown:

You could make a README locally and push it to the repo or on GitHub if you haven't made one on initialisation. 



Github Gists
Gists are a simple way to share code snippets and useful fragments with others. Gists are much easier to create, 
but offer far fewer features than a typical Github repo.
A lot of gists are also markdown files. 
Can be made public or private. 
Created using the add dropdown on Github.
