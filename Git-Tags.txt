Tags are pointers that refer to particular points in Git history.
We can mark a particular moment in time with a tag.
Tags are most often used to mark version releases in projects. 

Think of tags as branch references that DO NOT CHANGE. 
Once a tag is created, it always refers to the same commit. 
It's just a label for a commit. 

There are two types of Git Tag: lightweight and annotated tags

Lightweight tags are just a name/label that points to a particular commit. 

Annotated tags store extra meta data including the author's name and email, the dtae and a tagging message (like a commit message)
