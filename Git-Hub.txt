Git Hub is a repo hosting website, the best known and most used place to store source code. Welcome to The Grid. 

CLONING

git clone <url>       (Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repo and will copy them to your local machine. It will also initialize a new repo on your
                        machine, giving you access to the full git history of the cloned project. Because of this it is vital to not be in a repo when you clone,
                        clone replaces git init in this circumstance. Anyone can clone any public repo, you do not need to be an owner or collaborator.)

**You do not need to have an account to clone, just the HTML link**

git clone works with any hosted repo, not just github based repos

HOW DO I GET MY CODE ON GITHUB???

Option 1: If you already have an existing repo locally that you want to get on github - 1) Create a new repo on GitHub, 2) Connect your local repo (add a remote), 3) Push up your changes

Option 2: If you haven't begun work on your local repo - 1) Create a new repo on Github, 2) Clone it down to your machine, 3) Do some work locally, 4) Push up your changes to GitHub
