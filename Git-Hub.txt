Git Hub is a repo hosting website, the best known and most used place to store source code. Welcome to The Grid. 

CLONING

git clone <url>       (Git will retrieve all the files associated with the repo and will copy them to your local machine. It will also initialize a new repo on your
                        machine, giving you access to the full git history of the cloned project. Because of this it is vital to not be in a repo when you clone,
                        clone replaces git init in this circumstance. Anyone can clone any public repo, you do not need to be an owner or collaborator.)

**You do not need to have an account to clone, just the HTML link**

git clone works with any hosted repo, not just github based repos





HOW DO I GET MY CODE ON GITHUB???

Option 1: If you already have an existing repo locally that you want to get on github - 1) Create a new repo on GitHub, 2) Connect your local repo (add a remote), 3) Push up your changes

Option 2: If you haven't begun work on your local repo - 1) Create a new repo on Github, 2) Clone it down to your machine, 3) Do some work locally, 4) Push up your changes to GitHub

ADDING A REMOTE

Before we can push anything to GitHub, we need to tell Git about our remote repo on GitHub i.e. setting a destination to push to. 
in Git, we refer to these "destinations" as remotes. Each remote is simply a URL where a hosted repo lives. 


***IMPORTANT: When cloning or pushing our personal stuff etc we are using the SSH Key, so make sure you use the SSH link for the remote NOT Https***
Finding the SSH link for a repo: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/22394

git remote or git remote -v     (Allows you to view any existing remotes for your repo, -v stands for verbose which gives you more info)

git remote add <name> <URL>    (creates a named (typically "origin") remote for the URL of the GitHub repo)

git remote rename <old-name> <new-name>       (changes remote name)

git remote remove <name>      (removes remote)


PUSHING

Pushing is when we send work to GitHub (doesn't need to specifically be GitHub but you know what I mean). 

git push <remote> <branch>       (we need to specify the remote (named location) we want to push to AND the specific local branch we want to push to that remote)

example: git push origin main
