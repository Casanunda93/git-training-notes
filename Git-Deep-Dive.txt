None of this is particularly necessary to know but these are some attributes of the .git folder (the hidden folder of any repo)



The local config file

The config file is for configuration (duh). We've seen how to configure global settings like our name and email across all Git repos, but we can also configure things on a per-repo basis. 

git config --local      (We can make changes to this file via command line as we have done before or we can open this file and make changes directly to it.) 



The refs directory (references)

Inside refs, you'll find a heads directory. refs/heads contains one file per branch in a repo. Each file is named after a branch and contains the has of the commit at the tip of the branch e.g. refs/heads/master contains the commit hash of the last commit on the master branch. Refs also contains a refs/tags folder which contains one file for each tag in the repo. 



The HEAD file

HEAD is just a text file that keeps track of where HEAD points. 
If it contains refs/heads/master, this means that HEAD is pointing to the master branch. 
In detatched HEAD, the HEAD file contains a commit hash instead of a branch reference. 


The objects directory

The objects directory contains all the repo files.
This is where Git stores the backups of files, the commits in a repo and more. 
The files are all compressed and encrypted, so they won't look like much.
