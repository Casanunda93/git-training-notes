Reflogs (reference logs)

Git keeps a record of when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the repo. 
We can view and update these reference logs using the git reflog command. 

*** Limitations: Git only keeps reflogs on your local activity. They are not shared with collaborators. 
Reflogs also expire. Git cleans out old entries after around 90 days, though this can be configured. ***

git reflog       (git reflog accepts subcommands show, expire, delete and exists. Show is the only commonly used variant and is the default subcommand)

git reflog show HEAD     (git reflog show will show the log of a specific reference, defaults to HEAD)

example: to view the logs for the tip of the main branch we could run: git reflog show main
