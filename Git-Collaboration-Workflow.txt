Centralized Workflow: Everyone works on Main/Master i.e, the most basic workflow possible. 

The simplest collaborative workflow is to have everyone work on the main branch. 
It's straightforward and can work for tiny teams but it has quite a few shortcomings. 

So every collaborator clones the remote repo, adds and commits, pulls other commits, deals with merge conflicts.
This can be an issue if someone needs to commit broken code for discussion etc. 

The Problem: While it's nice and easy to only work on the master branch, this leads to some serious issues with teams - Lots of time spent resolving conflicts and merging code, especially as team size scales up - No one can work on anything without disturbing the main codebase, how do you try adding someting radically differnt? How do you experiment? - The only way to collab on a feature together with another teammate is to push incomplete code to main. Other teammates now have broken code.
