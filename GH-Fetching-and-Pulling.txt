Remote Tracking Branch: Follows the pattern <remote>/<branch> e.g origin/master
"At the time you last communicated with this remote repo, here is where x branch was pointing"
A reference to the state of the branch on the remote version of the repo, picture a book mark pointing to the last known commit on the master branch of origin. 

git branch -r       (view the remote branches our local repo knows about)

Once you start adding new commits to the local repo, if you don't push those commits to github then the local repo will show you are ahead of origin/main by a certain number of commits. if you wanted to see what the repo looked like at origin/main, you could always go into a detached head state to have a look:

git checkout origin/master     (view the state of the origin/main remote repo in detached HEAD state, see time-traveling.txt, git switch main to reattach head)
