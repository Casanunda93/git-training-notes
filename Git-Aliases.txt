The Global Config File

Git looks for the global config file at either ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config
Any configuration variables that we change in the file will be applied across all Git repos. 
We can also alter config variables from the command line. 

cat ~/.gitconfig           (prints contents of the global config file)
