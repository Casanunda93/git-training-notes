The Global Config File

Git looks for the global config file at either ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config
Any configuration variables that we change in the file will be applied across all Git repos. 
We can also alter config variables from the command line. 

cat ~/.gitconfig           (prints contents of the global config file)



Adding aliases - custom commands

We can easily set up Git aliases to make our Git experience a bit simpler and faster. 
For example we could define an alias "git ci" instead of having to type "git commit"
Or we could define a custom git lg command that prints out a custom formatted commit log.

[alias]
    s = status                      (custom command "git s" which will run git status)
    l = log                         (custom command "git l" which will run git log)

You just add the aliases you want to the config file. 
You can also do it via command line:

git config --global alias.Br branch      (custom command "git Br" which will run git branch)


Aliases with Arguments
Arguments are automatically passed through when you defin an alias.

Example:

[alias]
    cm = commit -m                        (custom command "git cm" which will run git commit -m)

If you then run:
    git cm "Message"
The message will be passed through and added to the alias, meaning the message will work.


***WARNING: Aliases are personal, you can become accustomed to them. This can be an issue if you become too reliant ***
